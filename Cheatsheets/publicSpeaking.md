* Send slides to organizer, co-speaker
* ... or bring you slides on a stick, upfront
* don't rely on (good) wifi

# Content, personal

* Know how you'll begin and end - memorize you first and last sentence

## Peptalk

* Connect with the audience - in the end it's all about them
* The audience wants you to succeed
* people won't know if you missed something

## Training Techniques
* Powerpoint Karaoke
* Lightning Talk
* Labling - use daily standups to practice public speaking
